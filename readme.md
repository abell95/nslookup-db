# nslookup-db

Andrew Bell - Code project for CS 372

This site allows you to run nslookup online.
You probably could just use it by command line, but you might be lazy or not know how.
In such a case, I pity you and implore you to use my site.

The input expects a full URL - i.e. `https://www.example.com`, it will not permit something like `www.youtube.com` or just `google.com`

## Steps for installation and running:

1. Make sure Node is installed
2. Clone to local machine
3. Navigate to dir and run `npm install` in command line
4. Run `node app`
